I did a project where I fused RStudio, with PowerBi. 
I started with a large set of data, and through RStudio, I was able to filter, and clean the data, then going onto nicely presenting the data in tables and all sorts on PowerBi.
I imported onto PowerBi through '.csv' version of my RStudio 'clean_df' file.
Please find attached, my PowerBi and my RStudio Project respectfully.
